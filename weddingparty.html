                                         a joy because we watch each other grow and push one another to be great. I’ll never forget 
                                         the day she and the rest of my family dropped me off for undergrad and, when it was time for 
                                         them to leave she and I looked at one another and both burst out in tears lol. P.S. Thanks for 
                                         being my motivation and one of my biggest cheerleaders.</p>

                            <p>We go way back to middle school when we were wearing uniforms and phat farm shoes. We lost touch for a while after I moved but
                              ran into each other on the field during a band practice at NCCU. In short, smart, cool, and he’ll probably be one of the freshest guys you’ve ever
                            seen.</p>
